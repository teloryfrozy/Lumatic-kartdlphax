💡 Notes:

👉 Due to changes in the 11.17 version, we had to choose an other exploit to install CFW on them. It should work for 11.16 and 11.17 consoles
👉 The following folders are empty:

- "ressources/games" : put the .cia files that you want to install using the hack + apps method
- "ressources/TWiLightMenu/roms"  : put the roms of your favorite retro-games inside (not the .3ds files, only the ones that works with TWiLightMenu
- "ressources/Themes": put the themes (.zip files) that you want to see on the background of your console

👉 This tool does all the computer part but you still have to do the manual part on your console. You can find the official guide here: https://3ds.hacks.guide/installing-boot9strap-(kartdlphax).html
